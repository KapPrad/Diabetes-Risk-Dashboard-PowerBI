# ðŸ©º Diabetes Risk Analysis Dashboard

This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes, analyzes, and uncovers hidden patterns in diabetes risk based on demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors. It goes beyond visualization into ethical data design and model fairness â€” ideal for public health and AI use cases.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Analyze 10,000 synthetic patient records with 21 features
- Identify high-risk intersections using BMI, glucose, age, ethnicity, and lifestyle
- Balance the dataset for fair ML modeling (equal Normal, Prediabetic, Diabetic)
- Deliver actionable visual insights for early intervention

## ðŸ§  Key Insights
- 85% overall diabetic prevalence â€” mostly in age 30â€“59
- Normal BMI individuals can still have elevated HbA1c
- 91% diabetic rate in low activity + heavy alcohol users
- Chronic sugar levels (HbA1c) elevated across all ethnicities

##ðŸ“Š Tools & Features

-Power BI: Dashboard creation, visual storytelling, slicers, filters
-DAX: Custom measures for prevalence, sorting, percentage calculations
-Power Query: Data cleaning, conditional columns, AgeBand creation, BMI categorization
Visuals Used:
-Bubble charts (Glucose vs BMI, sized by HbA1c)
-Matrix heatmaps (Age Ã— BMI â†’ Risk)
-Line charts (Glucose by Age & Ethnicity)
-Donuts, clustered bars, KPIs


## ðŸš€ Outcomes
This dashboard highlights how diabetes hides across behavior and demographic lines, enabling fairer and smarter decisions. It's ready for integration into EHR systems, public health reporting, or machine learning pipelines.
